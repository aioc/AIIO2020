R/L facing statue patterns:
    Alternating-L : LRLRLRLR...
    Alternating-R : RLRLRLRL...
    L-Then-R      : LLLLLL...LRRRRR...R
    R-Then-L      : RRRRRR...RLLLLL...L
    RandomHalf    : random.shuffle([L]*MAX_N/2 + [R]*MAX_N/2)
    Circle        : MAX_N statues. The i-th statue ls R facing with probability i/MAX_N (otherwise it is L).

Quota Patterns:
    Random            : [random.choice(1, MAX_F)]
    Random Ascending  : Random, but then sorted
    Random Descending : Random Ascending, but then reversed
    Valley            : Random ascending to the middle, then random descending
    Mountain          : Random descending to the middle, then random ascending

---------------------------
Subtask 1 & 2: D = 0
---------------------------

Handmade cases:

3 cases with N = 6 and statues face RLRLRL.
Flower quotas are:
    * 9+101 3 6+100 6 3+100 9
    * 9+100 3 6+101 6 3+100 9
    * 9+100 3 6+100 6 3+101 9

Min cases:
    * N = 1, statue faces L
    * N = 1, statue faces R

Max answer: N = 2, statues face LR, flower quota is [1e9, 1e9].

Domination:
    * RLLLL, [100, 90, 3, 55, 99, 6]
    * RRRRL, [80, 5, 23, 99, 100]

For Sub 2, generate the Sub 5 cases, and remove all the deletions.
For Sub 1, generate the Sub 5 cases, but with N = 1000, and remove all the deletions.


---------------------------------------------
Subtask 3: Only demolish right facing statues
---------------------------------------------

Take Sub 5 cases, and remove all the left-facing deletions.

--------------------------------------
Subtask 4: Demolish from left to right
--------------------------------------

Take Sub 4 cases, and change the deletions so that they go from left to right.

Subtask 5
---------

sub5-RL) 
    R-Then-L, R's Random descending, L's Random ascending.
    Then, pick 0.01*MAX_N random statues and halve their F_i.
    Then demolish from highest to lowest F_i.
sub5-LR)
    Like sub5-RL, but L-Then-R instead.


sub5-circle)
    Circle, R's Random descending, L's Random ascending.
    Demolish in the order 1, N, 2, N-1, 3, N-2, ...
    (The goal of this case is to make the critical statue somewhere in the middle
    for most of the answers)

sub5-circle-flat)
    Like sub5-circle, but values are in the range [1, 10] only.

sub5-valley-1)
    Alternating-L, L's Valley, R's Valley.
    Demolish the ascending portions of the valleys first, in ascending order of F
    then demlosih the descending portions of the valleys in any order

sub5-valley-2)
    Same as valley 1, but swap ascending/descending in the description of the demolition order

sub5-descending)
    RandomHalf, R's descending, L's ascending.
    But, take the last R and the first L (i.e. the ones with the smallest F)
    and set their F to MAX_F.

sub5-random)
    RandomHalf, L's random, R's random.

sub5-all-left)
    All Ls, Random values. Delete randomly

sub5-all-right)
    Like all-left, but R instead.
